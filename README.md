# Synopsis

makeChange is a web app that we put together for the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly.  The requirements for the project were that it had to use a server, a front-end framework, and a third party API.  We decided our app would be a vehicle for users to make micro-donations to any charity that is important to them.

# Motivation

After doing a bit of research, we found that a sense of urgency, an attainable goal, and a personal connection were all the motivators for people to give money to non-profits. We decided to design makeChange with that in mind. 

To give people a sense of urgency, we wanted to keep the donation campaigns limited to 72 hours after the initial donation was made. We wanted to give people an easy way to share their donation campaigns and increase their chance of success so we implemented social share to advertise them on Facebook and Twitter.

To make sure people had an attainable goal, we wanted to implement a clear progress bar for each campaign and set the goal at something very low so the user could reach that feeling of success as soon as possible.  We settled on the goal being 5 dollars.

And finally, in order to guarantee the user had a personal connection to a non-profit on our site, we wanted to make sure they had access to EVERY non-profit registered with the IRS and able to recieve charitable donations. We also wanted them to be able to search those charities by name (if they know exactly which charity they are looking for), category (if they only know what cause is important to them), and location (if they want to support something local).
